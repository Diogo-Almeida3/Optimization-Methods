## General info
This work was carried out in the scope of the Curricular Unit of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, aiming to conceive, implement and test optimization methods that find good quality solutions.
We are presented with a maximization problem where we are given a number of elements (M) and a number of subsets (G). The objective is to maximize the sum of the diversities (Quality) of each subset, which is composed by the sum of N=M/G distances.
